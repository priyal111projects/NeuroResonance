# 🧠 NeuroResonance

**NeuroResonance** is a real-time stress detection and auditory therapy prototype that blends neuroscience with ancient Vedic sound healing. It simulates brainwave activity and plays sacred mantras like *OM*, *Gayatri*, and *Mahamrityunjaya* when stress crosses a defined threshold. The project explores the emotional and cognitive effects of high-frequency sound therapy, using Python and basic signal processing techniques.

## 🔍 Project Goal

To investigate the impact of high-frequency mantras on stress levels using simulated EEG-like data, offering a non-invasive sound-based method for mental relaxation and focus restoration.
